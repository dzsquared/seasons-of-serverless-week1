# Challenge 1: The Perfect Holiday Turkey ü¶É

## The challenge üçΩ 

Convert a brine equation (below) and cook time to an automated process so that when you input a turkey's weight, you will be given the amount of water, sugar, salt, and spices to add and a recommendation on how long to cook it.

Let's assume you have available a large cooler for your turkey and its brine and that it's defrosted.

Our chefs recommends trying an Azure Function to generate your recipe, and encourages you to share your own turkey secrets by adding a link to your solution in the Issues tab!

Here in North America, many families believe that the holidays are simply not complete without a proper turkey on the table. Juicy meat, crispy skin, mouth-watering gravy: a good turkey has it all! The only problem is these birds can be hard to cook so they don't turn out dry and tough. The secret? A proper brine! 

Here's a [sample recipe](https://www.aspicyperspective.com/best-turkey-brine-recipe/) for that important process in the production of a perfect turkey.

There's a science to a great turkey brine, but we, as software engineers, are both absent-minded and need an automated way to remind ourselves each year of the proper percentages of ingredients of a good brine, based on the weight of the turkey.

According to Chef Darren's calculations, the brine equation and roast recommendation looks like this:
### Brine Instructions

- Salt (in cups) = 0.05 * lbs of turkey
- Water (gallons) = 0.66 *  lbs of turkey
- Brown sugar (cups)  = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Shallots = 0.2 * lbs of turkey
- Cloves of garlic = 0.4 * lbs of turkey
- Whole peppercorns (tablespoons) = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Dried juniper berries (tablespoons) = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Fresh rosemary (tablespoons) = 0.13 * lbs of turkey
- Thyme (tablespoons) = 0.06 * lbs of turkey
- Brine time (in hours) = 2.4 * lbs of turkey
- Roast time (in minutes) = 15 * lbs of turkey
